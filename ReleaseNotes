# Release Info:
v1.07.01

  1. ManualConfig         - Flag missing when asserting --sqlite option.  This is cosmetic but fixing anyway (--databases is ok)

v1.07.00

  1. Mac start/stop       - DBRepair now supports start/stop from the menu.
                            Default configuration is for MacOS to tell you what it's doing (Haptic).  Set to 0 for silence.

  2. Code cleanup         - Minor code cleanup / dead code removal.

v1.06.02

  1. Bug fix              - Fixed incorrect error handling when command line arguments not valid in manual configuration mode.
                            Fixed incorrect reporting of what was wrong in manual configuration mode.

v1.06.01

  1. Manual SQLite path   - You many now also specify the full path to "Plex SQLite".  ( example: "/tmp/downloads/Plex SQLite")
                            DBRepair.sh will automatically figure out which form to use (path or directory)

                            --sqlite "/real/host/path/to/plexmediaserver/Directory"
                            --sqlite "/real/host/path/to/plexmediaserver/directory/Plex SQLite"

v1.06.00

  1. Manual configuration - You may now run DBRepair from outside container environments.
                            This provides a method for running DBRepair when container healthcheck prevents it.

                            The directories to both:

                            a. Where Plex SQLite can be found:     ( --sqlite "/real/host/path/to/plexmediaserver/Directory" )
                            b. Where the databases can be found:   ( --databases "/real/host/path/to/Plugin Support/Databases" )

                            If used, these options MUST precede all other command line options

                            WARNING:  The host MUST provide all standard commands AND support "stat -c" option.  Bash commands will NOT autoconfigure.


  2. "Exit" when scripted:  The previously annoyance which required "exit" to be specified on the command line (scripted) has been fixed.
                            "exit" is no longer required in this use.

                            "exit" or "quit" is still required in interactive use.

  3. Windows:               DBRepair-Windows now supports 32 bit PMS on 64 bit Windows base systems. (Mixed mode operation)

v1.05.02

  1. HOTIO image paths      HOTIO images have again changed PMS executable location.  This update
                            adds support for the lastest location.

v1.05.01

  1. MacOS -                Transcoder cache directory uses different location than default Plex.
                            Make "CacheDir" variable.
  2. PPM files -            Prune old PPM files just as other image files are pruned.

v1.05.00

  1. Kubernetes support -   Add support for Kubernetes (and also TrueNAS) containers.

v1.04.00

  1. SNAP support -         Add support for Plex Media Server SNAP package.

v1.03.00

  1. New command: Purge -   Removes old image files from the Trancoder cache.
                            These are normally removed during scheduled maintenance.
                            If scheduled maintenance doesn't complete all tasks,  they won't get removed
                            and will build up.

                            This command allows you to remove them.

                            The default age is 30 days.  Files older than 30 days will be purged.

  2. Introduces Environment variable support (customizing) DBRepair operation.

    - DBREPAIR_PAGESIZE:    DBREPAIR_PAGESIZE=N  (where N is a multiple of 1024, less equal 65536)
                            This sets the Plex SQLite database page_size during optimization operations.
                            It's most beneficial on ZFS filesystems to allow tuning to the Dataset size.

    - DBREPAIR_CACHEAGE:    DBREPAIR_CACHEAGE=N  (where N is the max age, in Days) to retain when purging
                            older image files in the Cache/PhotoTranscoder directory.
                            This variable allows you to set the purge age (greater than "N" days).

v1.02.01

  - Minor fix to logging.  One line of output at the console was not present in the logfile
    (this is important when diagnosing after connection-loss scenarios and DBRepair.sh was interrupted)

  - Added documentation in README.md for using DBRepair with Synology DSM 7 Task Scheduler.
    (Maintains app-armor compliance)

v1.02.00

  - Provide menu option to ignore/honor "Duplicate" and "UNIQUE Constraint" errors during DB Repair,
    and when importing data from other databases.
    This is equivalent to the '-i' command line option but now can be used interactively.

  - Fixed.  ConfirmYesNo would print error message when it shouldn't.
  - Fixed.  Erroneous echo of your reply when responding to yes/no questions.

v1.01.04

  - Missing IgnoreErrors (-i / -f) test when reimporting damaged DB with certain errors prevented repair
    in all cases.

v1.01.02

  - Correct updating when scripted versus interactive.

v1.01.00

  - Adds ability to self download and install latest version of DBRepair.sh
  - Slightly changes numbering style to accommodate future updates with new update capability.
  - Thanks to @causefx for his contributions to this release

v1.0.13

  - Improve HOTIO support.  Allow both older and newer directory structure

v1.0.12

  - Update HOTIO start/stop commands (re: #404461a)

v1.0.11

  - Correct PMS stop problem.   Stop operation would not wait until PMS actually stopped.
    Now DBRepair waits up to 30 seconds for PMS to stop before issuing error


v1.0.10

  - Correct bug when importing watch lists.   Negative watch counts could occur.
    This release corrects the issue.

v1.0.9

  - When recovering a damaged database,  it is sometimes necessary to ignore constraint errors resulting from damaged indexes.

    This update provides command line options to support this:

    1.   -i  or -f   -  Ignore DB check errors / Force acceptance.
    2.   -p          -  When importing viewstate from another DB, purge duplicate counts.
                        (Use with extreme caution).

    Usage:   DBRepair.sh [Options] commands
    Example: DBRepair.sh -i -p  start auto stop exit


v1.0.8
  - Require root UID (super user).
    Requiring root UID gives the script the privilege necessary to set the database ownership
    and permissions to what they were when the tool started.  Without this,  the resultant database
    might not be accessible by the Plex Media Server user.

    Synology:   This is achieved by typing 'sudo -su root' at the command line prompt
                and entering your password.

    QNAP:       This is achieved by typing 'sudo -su admin' at the command line prompt
                and entering your password.

    Containers: Containers run as 'root' at the command line by default.

    Other platforms will be similar to the above.  Please try combinations of 'sudo'
    and 'sudo --help' for more details.

  - When successful,  you'll see a '#' in the prompt (signifies 'root' level privilege)

v1.0.7
  - Correct conditional test on Binhex container which prevented proper detection.
    Redact v1.0.6

v1.0.6
  - Correct detection conflict between Arch Linux native package and Binhex container.

v1.0.5
  - Add Arch Linux Support
  - Put system override processing in function
  - Separate Quit (99) and Exit functionality to reduce confusion about temp file removal.

v1.0.4
  - Correct Start/Stop problem on some hosts

v1.0.3
  - Use POSIX free space calculation on all systems

# Introduction

DBRepair provides database repair and maintenance for the most common  Plex Media Server database problems.
It is a simple menu-driven utility with a command line backend.

While it does correct the following errors,  it can't correct 'data' errors with the individual records.
These type changes can only be performed by PMS.
## Situations and errors commonly seen include:

      1. Searching is sluggish
      2. Database is malformed / damaged / corrupted
      3. Database has bloated from media addition or changes
      4. Damaged indexes damaged

## Functions provided

 The utility accepts command names.
 Command names may be upper/lower case and may also be abbreviated (4 character minimum).

 The following commands (or their number), listed in alphabetical order,  are accepted as input.

   AUTO(matic)  - Automatically check, repair/optimize, and reindex the databases in one step.
   CHEC(k)      - Check the main and blob databases integrity
   EXIT         - Exit the utility
   IMPO(rt)     - Import viewstate / watch history from another database
   REIN(dex)    - Rebuild the database indexes
   REPL(ace)    - Replace the existing databases with a PMS-generated backup
   SHOW         - Show the log file
   STAR(t)      - Start PMS (not available on all platforms)
   STOP         - Stop PMS  (not available on all platforms)
   UNDO         - UNDO the last operation
   VACU(um)     - Vacuum the databases


### The menu

  The menu gives you the option to enter either a 'command number' or the 'command name/abbreviation'.
  For clarity, each command's name is 'quoted'.

### General installation and usage instructions

        1. Open your browser to https://github.com/ChuckPa/PlexDBRepair/releases/latest
        2. Download the source code (tar.gz or ZIP) file

        3. Knowing the file name will always be of the form 'PlexDBRepair-X.Y.Z.tar.gz'
           --  where X.Y.Z is the release number.  Use the real values in place of X, Y, and Z.
        4. Place the tar.gz file in the appropriate directory on the system you'll use it.
        5. Open a command line session (usually Terminal or SSH)
        6. Elevate privilege level to root (sudo) if needed.
        7. Extract the utility from the tar or zip file
        8. 'cd' into the extraction directory
        9. Give DBRepair.sh 'execute' permission  (chmod +x)
       10. Invoke ./DBRepair.sh




###   EXAMPLE:  To install & launch on Synology DSM 6

        cd /volume1/Plex
        sudo bash
        tar xf PlexDBRepair-x.y.z.tar.gz
        cd PlexDBRepair-x.y.z
        chmod +x DBRepair.sh
        ./DBRepair.sh


###    EXAMPLE: Using DBRepair inside containers (manual start/stop included)

#### (Select containers allow stopping/starting PMS from the menu.  See menu for details)

        sudo docker exec -it plex /bin/bash

        # extract from downloaded version file name then cd into directory
        tar xf PlexDBRepair-1.0.0.tar.gz
        cd PlexDBRepair-1.0.0
        chmod +x DBRepair.sh
        ./DBRepair.sh
```
###    EXAMPLE:  Using DBRepair on regular Linux native host (Workstation/Server)
```
        sudo bash
        cd /path/to/DBRepair.tar
        tar xf PlexDBRepair-1.0.0.tar.gz
        cd PlexDBRepair-1.0.0
        chmod +x DBRepair.sh
        ./DBRepair.sh stop auto start exit
```

###    EXAMPLE: Using DBRepair from the command line on MacOS (on the administrator account)
```
        osascript -e 'quit app "Plex Media Server"'
        cd ~/Downloads
        tar xvf PlexDBRepai PlexDBRepair-1.0.0.tar.gz
        cd PlexDBRepai PlexDBRepair-1.0.0

        chmod +x DBRepair.sh
        ./DBRepair.sh



## Typical usage

This utility can only operate on PMS when PMS is in the stopped state.
If PMS is running when you startup the utility,  it will tell you.

These examples

  A. The most common usage will be the "Automatic" function.

    Automatic mode is where DBRepair determines which steps are needed to make your database run optimally.
    For most users, Automatic is equivalent to 'Check, Repair, Reindex'.
    This repairs minor damage, vacuums out all the unused records, and rebuilds search indexes in one step.

  B. Database is malformed  (Backups of  com.plexapp.plugins.library.db and com.plexap.plugins.library.blobs.db available)
     Note: You may attempt "Repair" sequence

    1. (3)  Check   - Confirm either main or blobs database is damaged
    2. (9)  Replace - Use the most recent valid backup -- OR -- (5) Repair.  Check date/time stamps for best action.
                    -- If Replace fails, use Repair (5)
                    -- (Replace can fail if the database has been damaged for a long time.)
    3. (6)  Reindex - Generate new indexes so PMS doesn't need to at startup
    4. (99) Exit

  C. Database is malformed - No Backups
    1. (3)  Check   - Confirm either main or blobs database is damaged
    2. (5)  Repair  - Salavage as much as possible from the databases and rebuild them into a usable database.
    3. (6)  Reindex - Generate new indexes so PMS doesn't need to at startup
    4. (99) Exit

  C. Database sizes excessively large when compared to amount of media indexed (item count)
    1. (3)  Check   - Make certain both databases are fully intact  (repair if needed)
    2. (4)  Vacuum  - Instruct SQLite to rebuild its tables and recover unused space.
    3. (6)  Reindex - Rebuild Indexes.
    4. (99) Exit

  D. User interface has become 'sluggish' as more media was added
    1. (3)  Check   - Confirm there is no database damage
    2. (5)  Repair  - You are not really repairing.  You are rebuilding the DB in perfect sorted order.
    3. (6)  Reindex - Rebuild Indexes.
    4. Exit    - (Option 9)

  E. Undo
    Undo is a special case where you need the utility to backup ONE step.
    This is rarely needed.  The only time you might want/need to backup one step is if Replace leaves you worse off
    than you were before. In this case, UNDO then Repair.  Undo can only undo the single most-recent action.
    (Note: In a future release, you will be able to 'undo' every action taken until the DBs are in their original state)

Special considerations:

    1. As stated above, this utilty requires PMS to be stopped in order to do what it does.
    2. - This utility CAN sit at the menu prompt with PMS running.
       - You did a few things and want to check BEFORE exiting the utility
       - If you don't like how it worked out,
        -- STOP PMS
        -- UNDO the last action and do something else
        -- OR do more things to the databases
    3. When satisfied,  Exit the utility.
       - There is no harm in keeping the database temp files (except for space used)
       - ALL database temps are named with date-time stamps in the name to avoid confusion.
    4. The Logfile ('show' command) shows all actions performed WITH timestamp so you can locate intermediate databases
       if desired for special / manual recovery cases.


## Scripting support

  Certain platforms don't provide for each command line access.
  To support those products,  this utility can be operated by adding command line arguments.

  Another use of this feature is to automate Plex Database maintenance
  ( Stop Plex,  Run this sequence,  Start Plex ) at a time when the server isn't busy


  The command line arguments are the same as if typing at the menu.

  Example:   ./DBRepair.sh  stop auto start exit

  This executes:   Stop PMS,  Automatic (Check, Repair, Reindex), Start PMS, and Exit commands


## Exiting

  When exiting,  you will be asked whether to keep the interim temp files created during this session.
  If you've encountered any difficulties or aren't sure what to do,  don't delete them.
  You'll be able to ask in the Plex forums about what to do.  Be prepared to present the log file to them.


## Sample interactive session

  This is a typical manual session if you aren't sure what to do and want the tool to decide.

## Logfile

  The logfile (DBRepair.log) keeps track of all commands issues and their status (PASS/FAIL) with timestamp.
  This can be useful when recovering from an interrupted session because temporary files are timestamped.

# Command Reference:

### Automatic

  Automatic provides automated processing of most checks and repairs.  (Check, Repair/Resequence, Index)
  In its current state,  it will not automatically replace a damaged database from a backup (future)

  It will not stop PMS as not all systems support stopping PMS from within this tool.

### Check

  Checks the integrity of the Plex main and blobs databases.

### Exit

  Exits the utility and removes all temporary database files created during processing.
  To save all intermediate databases,  use the 'Quit' command.

### Import

  Imports (raw) watch history from another PMS database without ability to check validity
  ( This can have side effects of "negative watch count" being displayed.   Caution is advised. )


### Reindex

  Rebuilds the database indexes after an import, repair, or replace operation.
  These indexes are used by PMS for searching (both internally and your typed searches)

### Repair

  Extracts/recovers all the usable data fron the existing databases into text (SQL ascii) form.
  Repair then creates new SQLite-valid databases from the extracted/recovered data.

  The side effect of this process is a fully defragmented database (optimal for Plex use).

  100% validity/usability by Plex  is not guaranteed as the tool cannot validate each individual
  record contained in the database.  It can only validate at the SQLite level.

  In most cases, Repair is the preferred option as the records extracted are only those SQLite deemed valid.

### Replace

  Looks through the list of available PMS backups.

  Starting with the most recent PMS backup,
    1.  Check the both db files
    2.  If valid, offer as a replacement choice
    3.  If accepted (Y/N question) then use as the replacement
        else advance to the next available backup
    4.  Upon completion, validate one final time.

### Quit

   Exits the utility but leaves the temporary databases intact (useful for making exhaustive backups)

### Show

  Shows the activity log.  The activity log is date/time stamped of all activity.

### Start

  On platform environments which support it, and when invoked by the 'root' user, the tool can start PMS.
  If not the 'root' user or on a platform which doesn't support it, "Not available" will be indicated.

### Stop

  On platform environments which support it,  and when invoked by the 'root' user,  the tool can stop PMS.
  If not the 'root' user or on a platform which doesn't support it, "Not available" will be indicated.

  PMS must be in the stopped state in order to operate on the database files.

### Undo

  Undo allows you to "Undo" the last Import, Repair, Replace, or Vacuum command.
  At present, it only allows the ONE most recent operation.
  (Future will support undoing more actions)

### Vacuum

  Instructs SQLite to remove the empty/deleted records and gaps from the databases.
  This is most beneficial after deleting whole library sections.
